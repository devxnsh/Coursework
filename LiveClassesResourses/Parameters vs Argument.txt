So this is an important document here. Please read it with care.

So basically there is an everlasting confusion between anyone starting with programming and learning about functions about what is the difference between a Parameter and an Argument.

A parameter is a variable which is listed in the brackets of the function header (the place where function is defined)

Then what is an Argument?

Basically, an argument is the actual value which can be a constant, variable or reference which is used when calling a function.

So when you are talking about a function, always use the word 'parameter' UNLESS you are talking of the value to be entered in the function.
